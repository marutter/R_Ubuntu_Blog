      <description>I am slowly rebuilding the set of packages in c2d4u for use with R 3.5.0. Since packages built under version 3.4.* are not compatible with 3.5.0, they all need to be rebuilt. This includes the packages that came with the new Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) release. It is taking some time.
One of the challenges with using Launchpad is that once a package is built, it needs to be published. This takes some time (around 20 minutes).</description>
