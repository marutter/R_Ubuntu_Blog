      <description>I am slowly rebuilding the set of packages in c2d4u for use with R 3.5.0. Since packages built under version 3.4.* are not compatible with 3.5.0, they all need to be rebuilt. This includes the packages that came with the new Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) release. It is taking some time.
One of the challenges with using Launchpad is that once a package is built, it needs to be published. This takes some time (around 20 minutes).</description>

      <description>This website is dedicted to R and Ubuntu. Mainly, it will be about how to install R in Ubuntu, notes about the c2d4u PPA I maintain, building R related packages on Ubuntu, and using R in general.
About Me I am currently the Associate Director of the School of Science at Penn State Behrend and an Associate Professor of Statistics at Behrend. I have been building R packages for Ubuntu for a very long time, since 2007.</description>
