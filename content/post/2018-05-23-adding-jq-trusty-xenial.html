<p>One of the advantages of using Launchpadâ€™s PPA system is that it allows you to easily use the work of others backporting packages to older releases.</p>
<p>For example, the package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jqr/index.html"><code>jgr</code></a> has a build requirement of libjq. <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> is a command-line JSON processor, and the <code>jqr</code> package is required by a small number of other R packages, either directly or indirectly. The Ubuntu packages libjq-dev is available in Bionic, but not be default in Trusty or Xenial.</p>
<p>Luckily a <a href="https://launchpad.net/~opencpu/+archive/ubuntu/jq">PPA</a> exists with its only purpose to provide backports for this library. This PPA has been added to PPA dependencies for the rebuild of c2d4u for R 3.5. You may need to enable that PPA in your system if you are interested in using packages requiring jq. Thanks to <a href="https://www.opencpu.org/">OpenCPU</a> for the jq backport.</p>
