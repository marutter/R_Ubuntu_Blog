86 new or updated packages added to c2d4u this weekend.  The new CRAN Task View [Missing Data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html), which was added last month.

A number of packages require R 3.5, so the number of packages updated on the R 3.5 version of c2d4u is less.  Also, the [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstan) package, and anything related are not available for Trusty.  This is due to the need of the C++14 standard for `rstan`.  If there are any suggestions on how to get this to build on Launchpad, let me know.
