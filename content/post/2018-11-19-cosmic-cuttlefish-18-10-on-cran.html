<p>R packages for Cosmic Cuttlefish (18.10) have been added to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~marutter/+archive/ubuntu/rrutter3.5">RRutter3.5 PPA</a> and therefore have been mirrored to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/">CRAN</a>. These are the base packages for R, plus the recommended packages as well as a couple of others (jags, ess, rpy2, and littler). Most of these are already available in the standard 18.10 repositories, but as packages are updated, I will update them for CRAN.</p>
<p>Since the lifespan of Cosmic Cuttlefish is so short (support ends July 2019), I will not be creating a version of c2d4u for Cosmic. If you want access to all of those packages, I suggest sticking to an LTS. And with Ubuntuâ€™s announcement that support for Bionic (18.04) has been extended to 10 years, it will be around for a while.</p>
