<p>After building 10,742 packages on Launchpad, I would like announce that cran2deb4ubuntu3.5 (c2d4u3.5 for short) is now available for testing and maybe even actually use. It wasnâ€™t difficult to find if you know your way around launchpad, but you can find the PPA here: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~marutter/+archive/ubuntu/c2d4u3.5" class="uri">https://launchpad.net/~marutter/+archive/ubuntu/c2d4u3.5</a></p>
<p>Many things to consider before you add this PPA to your Ubuntu machine.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The PPA supplies binaries for Trusty (14.04), Xenial (16.04), and Bionic (18.04).</p></li>
<li><p>They binaries are built against based on R 3.5.0, which is why a new PPA was required. If you are looking for packages for R 3.4.*, you can use <a href="https://launchpad.net/~marutter/+archive/ubuntu/c2d4u">c2d4u</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are looking for R 3.5.0 binaries for all current flavors of Ubuntu, I have another <a href="https://launchpad.net/~marutter/+archive/ubuntu/rrutter3.5">PPA</a>. c2d4u3.5 requires this PPA to work correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>The packages available on c2d4u3.5 are all the packages I can get to build based on what is available from all <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">CRAN Task Views</a>, and a couple of extra packages. It is over 3,400 r-cran packages, and they are updated about once a week. Expect a big update tomorrow (May 27th).</p></li>
<li><p>Some packages require other PPAs to install. They include <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kirillshkrogalev/+archive/ubuntu/ffmpeg-next">FFmpeg next</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~opencpu/+archive/ubuntu/jq">jq</a>, and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntu/ppa">ubuntugis-stable</a>. Only a small number of packages require these additional PPAs, but if you install fails, these might be the solution.</p></li>
<li><p>If you decide to utilize this PPA, please let me know if something is not working. There is no way I can test all 3,400+ packages and there are always little things that I miss. If there are issues, please contact me via email at marutter[at]gmail.com.</p></li>
<li><p>You may have a favorite package that is not on c2d4u3.5 or c2d4u. To ensure some sanity in my life, I have limited the packages to those on the CRAN Task Views. So the best way to get the package on c2d4u is to have added to a Task View. Requests to add individual packages may be ignored until I find time to respond.</p></li>
</ul>
